--  This package is the top-level package for the Alice standard library.
--
--  The Alice standard library provides a set of default implementations of
--  Alice interfaces and other utility functions used in Alice application. It
--  is designed to be used as a starting point for building Alice
--  applications, providing a set of common functionalities that can be
--  extended or replaced as needed. For example, the Alice CLI binary uses the
--  Logger and the Error_Handler implementations provided by the Alice
--  standard library to log messages and handle errors during the execution of
--  use cases.
--
--  The Alice standard library is not intended to be used as a standalone
--  library, but rather as a set of utilities that can be used in Alice
--  applications to provide a consistent and reliable set of functionalities
--  according to the Clean Architecture principles.
