# Alice

> **Alice** : *Adventures for Learning and Inspiring Coding Excellence*

## Presentation

Alice is an open source Ada programming language framework designed to help
programmers implement and explore different solutions to problems from
various sources, including Project Euler, Codingame and Advent of Code
(currently, Alice only support for Project Euler). With Alice, you can flex
your coding muscles and work on problems that challenge your creativity,
logic, and problem-solving skills.

At the heart of Alice is a commitment to coding excellence, and Ada and SPARK
are the perfect languages to bring this vision to life. As a high-level
programming language designed for safety, reliability, and efficiency, Ada
provides a powerful and flexible toolset for programmers to create robust and
scalable software solutions. With Ada, you can write clean, concise, and
elegant code that is easy to read and maintain, helping to ensure that your
programs are error-free and performant. So whether you're a seasoned Ada
programmer or new to the language, Alice is the perfect platform to hone your
skills and push your limits.

> ### See [Alice wiki](https://github.com/rocher/Alice/wiki) for more information.

## Collaboration

With Alice, you can collaborate in a variety of ways.

### Participate

   * Implement new solutions to challenging problems: there are +800 problems
     in Project Euler!

   * Improve existing algorithms or implement new ones.

   * Use parallelism to explore the search space using multiple tasks.

   * Share and export common functionality as new elements in the [Euler
     Tools](https://github.com/rocher/euler_tools) library.

   * Create awesome visualizations to problem solutions with a simple
     interface.

   * Explore algorithm behavior of problem solutions by adding new
     parameters.

### Develop

   * Develop new graphical interfaces using your preferred GUI library: GTK,
     SDL, SFML or LVGL, to mention some of them.

   * Refactor and improve the Alice framework itself to inspire new concepts
     towards coding excellence.

   * Start the development and integration of other problem sources. take a
     look at what's planned for [Codigame](codingame/TODO.md) and [Advent of
     Code](advent_of_code/TODO.md).

   * Integrate new sources of problems or challenges, learning sites or
     references. For example, would make sense to have Rosetta Code somehow
     integrated in Alice?

## Status

Alice is still in the early stages of development, and things are likely to
change as we continue to refine and improve the framework. While Alice is
still a work in progress, it is already starting to take shape as tool for
exploring the challenges of the aforementioned problem sources.
